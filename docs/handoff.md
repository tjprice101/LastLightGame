# Current state and handoff

**Last updated:** immersive full-viewport Free Battle presentation.

## Project state

- Phase: browser prototype; opening flow implemented.
- Confirmed goal: a cinematic gacha game inspired by Brave Frontier.
- Existing design asset: [character and weapon prompt guide](../Art/midjourney-character-style-prompt.md).
- Documentation entry points: [root README](../README.md),
  [documentation hub](README.md), and [AI instructions](../AGENTS.md).
- Stack: TypeScript, Phaser 3.90, Vite 7, Vitest 4; Node 22.12+.
- Implemented: animated title, fire/water/grass starter choice, explicit confirmation,
  local starter save, opening menu, saved-session continuation, save-error handling.
- Starter selection now includes bounded elemental reveals and original lore;
  first confirmation plays a companion awakening. Lore stays readable in the menu.
- Implemented primary screens: Home, Character Upgrades, Events. Home shows the
  companion and coming-later Squad/Summon buttons. Inventory is inside upgrades;
  Free Battle and Story are Home subactivities. Settings opens in a modal side drawer.
  Story displays the saved starter's lore/prologue; Events is a future placeholder. Motion settings
  save separately and update both canvas/CSS motion. Fractalis shows a persistent
  local balance; Lycalis is a label only. Upgrades and equipment remain previews.
- All valid version-1 starter saves continue unchanged, including water/grass.
  The earlier forced fire re-selection policy is superseded.
- Implemented: solo Free Battle using only the saved Infernis/Tizu/Flores, enemy waves,
  health/defense/damage/crit, one action per turn, ultimate-only recovery, all
  passives/skills/Last Flares, elemental effects, and persistent remappable hotkeys.
  See [rules and kit values](free-battle.md).
- Battle text now has opaque dark backing, stats/gauge/details at least 14px,
  instructions/logs 16px, readable disabled controls and defeated labels, and
  prominent keyboard focus. Only defeated artwork fades.
- Free Battle now uses a dedicated full-viewport field screen, without sanctuary
  chrome/nav. Unit sprites have no enclosing blue cards; name/stat readouts remain
  dark and readable. The compact HUD retains actions/hotkeys, end turn, restart,
  disclosures for full descriptions/log, and Settings. Quit Battle returns Home
  while preserving session/rewards. Small screens scroll vertically as needed.
- Each ally has Shatter Gauge: starts 0, caps 100, Light +20, Heavy +30,
  incoming enemy hit +10 (including shields). Skills cost 25/40 and Last Flare
  costs 100; skills no longer generate resource. Battle meters/buttons and the
  character kit show gauge/costs. No persistent-save schema change is needed.
- Six supplied images moved to Art/source; transparent runtime exports are in
  public/assets. Portraits use the new names but retain old save IDs.
- Grassy Field moved to `Art/source/backgrounds`, with a byte-identical landscape
  PNG in `public/assets/backgrounds`. It is wired behind the Free Battle arena;
  no unit-art alpha removal or square normalization is applied.
- Not implemented: rewarded quests, squad editing, summoning, upgrades/equipping,
  currency spending, Lycalis balances, item acquisition,
  accounts, cloud saves, backend, payments.
- Character Upgrades now previews the confirmed Tier 1 level-30 cap and Fracture
  into Tier 2: major stat improvements (values pending), reset to 0, +10 Lycalis.
  Tier 2 levels to 30 using different resources. Owner selected previews only
  until materials/stat bonuses are defined. Saves remain version 1, with no
  invented current level/tier, Lycalis balance, materials, or Fracture transactions.
- Every newly defeated enemy grants 5-10 Fractalis, including burn kills.
  `last-light.wallet` version 1 stores a zero-start nonnegative integer balance.
  Wallet writes precede battle-state commit; failures visibly reject the action.
  Currency survives exit/restart/reload; corrupt wallets are never overwritten.
- Repository: [tjprice101/LastLightGame](https://github.com/tjprice101/LastLightGame).
- Deployment: [GitHub Pages](https://tjprice101.github.io/LastLightGame/),
  configured for the [Actions workflow](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml).
- Local Git preserves the remote's initial `main` commit.

Inspect the workspace again when resuming; this snapshot is not proof that
later contributors have made no changes.

## What this handoff delivers

See [opening flow](opening-flow.md) for behavior and source references.
The original art guide is preserved; supplied PNG art replaces SVG placeholders.
Free Battle grants Fractalis enemy drops but no permanent roster grants. Broader design documents
still label unapproved production mechanics as proposed.

## Next recommended action

Solo starter selection/battles and supplied grassy scenery are now implemented.
Playtest solo balance for each of the three starter kits, then approve upgrade costs,
item ownership/uniqueness, and rewarded quest rules before connecting battle to
progression/economy. Add future animation frames without changing resolver results.

## Known gaps

- Prototype combat values were delegated and implemented; production balance,
  summon rates/prices, rewards, and squad editing rules remain open.
- Midjourney style-reference URL is absent; supplied runtime art is available.
- No confirmed story, target devices, runtime asset pipeline, or commercial plan.
- Phaser contributes most of the 1.2 MB uncompressed production bundle; Vite
  reports a chunk-size warning. Target-device performance has not been profiled.

## Verification

- Immersive field checks passed at 1280x720, 390x844, 320x640, and 844x390:
  scenery fills the viewport, sanctuary chrome/cards are absent, all five actions
  and full descriptions remain available, no horizontal overflow, and quit/re-entry
  preserves session/rewards without leaking hotkeys. Settings suspends input.
  Water/grass defeat screens retain the selected character and allow restart.
  Desktop/mobile screenshots reviewed; narrow/short screens scroll as needed.
- `npm test`: 80 passing tests for all three starter transitions and saved continuations,
  failed storage writes, lore/reveal budget, currency/slot/upgrade definitions,
  motion settings, combat formulas, all kits/passives, exact recovery/cooldown
  boundaries, status durations,   shield/heal caps, waves/defeat, hotkey validation, and every runtime unit PNG's
  960 x 960 RGBA export contract.
- Reward tests cover all six integer payouts 5-10, repeatable independent reward
  randomness, ultimate multi-kills, burn kills, no repeated dead-enemy/ally payouts,
  wallet persistence, corrupt-save preservation, overflow and write failures.
  Headless Edge verified immediate payout/display, failed-write rollback/retry,
  no duplicate after navigation/Settings, restart/reload retention, and visible
  unavailable/error state for corrupt wallets.
- Solo browser checks passed for each starter: new selection/confirmation, saved
  reload, matching lore, exactly one ally, Heavy/skill resource changes, Settings
  state preservation, and restart retaining the chosen character. Existing saves
  continue without replacement. Desktop 1280px and mobile 320px text checks
  measured at least 14px for battle details and >=4.5:1 contrast, including
  unavailable controls; no overflow or overlapping battle sides. Screenshots reviewed.
- Fracture content tests verify the exact Tier 1 -> Tier 2, level-30 cap, reset-0,
  +10 Lycalis rule and pending materials/stats. Production-preview headless Edge
  checks verify visible rules, seven upgrade areas, no enabled transactions,
  unchanged version-1 save, and 320px layout without overflow.
- Scenery tests verify the runtime PNG equals the preserved source and retains
  1456 x 816 RGB dimensions. Headless Edge decoded the image at 1280px and 320px,
  checked full arena coverage, aspect-preserving cover sizing, enemy-left/ally-right
  layout, and working attacks; screenshots were reviewed for readable battle cards.
- Shatter tests cover zero-start/independent gauges, exact costs for every starter
  ability (including support), insufficient-resource rejection without mutation,
  attack/incoming-hit gains and cap, shielded/lethal hits, no passive/burn gain,
  wave carryover, and ultimate-only recovery boundaries.
- Local headless Edge verified real battle UI: zero-start meters and disabled
  skills, Heavy +30, incoming-hit gains, 25/40 skill spending, next-turn availability,
  gauge cap, Last Flare cost/recovery/expiry, and 320px layout without overflow.
  Used a separate browser profile because the shared browser connection was unavailable.
- `npm run build`: strict type-check and production build pass; bundle warning above.
- `npm audit`: zero known dependency vulnerabilities after updating Vitest.
- `npm ci`: clean lockfile restore passes with npm 10 after stopping the
  project's development server to release Windows' esbuild executable lock.
- Earlier browser checks: all three original starters selected/saved/reloaded before
  the fire-only restriction; keyboard title entry; explicit
  selection gate; 390px layout without horizontal overflow; pointer completion;
  corrupt saves preserved with visible errors; failed writes do not advance;
  reduced-motion CSS verified.
- Browser test save changes were restored to the previous local value.
- Development server returned HTTP 200 at `/LastLightGame/`.
- [First deployment workflow](https://github.com/tjprice101/LastLightGame/actions/runs/37174431784)
  completed successfully. The public page returned HTTP 200, and a live browser
  check verified canvas/assets, starter selection, and saved reload with no
  uncaught browser errors.
- npm 10 hit a resolver error when upgrading Vitest; `npx npm@11.6.0 install`
  resolved it. The committed lockfile is used by `npm ci`.
- Reveal browser checks used DOM-triggered clicks because the shared browser tab
  was hidden and native input/animation actionability stalled. Verified all three
  lore/reveal variants, focus preservation, 12-mote limit, no preview save,
  first-arrival-only awakening, saved lore, reduced-motion styles, and 390px layout.
  Visual playback in a visible tab remains a manual check.
- Earlier menu checks: fire-only entry, preserved legacy save until confirmation,
  Fractalis/Lycalis labels, exactly eight artifacts plus one
  master relic, seven upgrade paths, readable story, future events, settings
  persistence and 390px layouts. DOM-triggered input was used for the hidden tab.
- Three-screen browser checks: exactly Home/Character Upgrades/Events navigation,
  Home Squad/Summon buttons, seven upgrade areas and integrated inventory, drawer
  motion persistence/focus return on every screen, battle input suspension/resumption,
  and no horizontal overflow at 320px. Storage and viewport were restored.
- Earlier Free Battle browser checks (before Shatter Gauge): all nine starter
  skills/ultimates, original heavy recovery, all six decoded assets, enemy-left/team-right mobile layout, hotkey
  remap/display/persistence/guards, duplicate rejection, listener cleanup on repeated
  navigation, and first-action-only resolution. Animation tests created all three
  ultimate variants and explicitly finished Web Animations to verify cleanup in the
  hidden shared tab; navigation cancellation preserves the resolved state.
- Alpha exports checked for transparent borders, partial-alpha edges, opaque
  interiors; a dark-background contact sheet was visually reviewed.
- [Free Battle deployment](https://github.com/tjprice101/LastLightGame/actions/runs/37176473879)
  passed. All six public PNGs returned HTTP 200; live browser checks verified
  decoded art, Cinder Cleave, Tidal Shelter, keyed Worldseed, enemy phase, and
  recovery without uncaught errors. Browser test storage was restored afterward.
- All 167 local documentation links/anchors across 19 Markdown documents resolved.
- Unit art standardized to centered 960 x 960 canvases, longest content dimension
  864px and minimum 48px padding. Source originals remain unchanged. Four Python
  image tests check aspect preservation, white-interior preservation, export
  occupancy/centering/padding, and empty-image rejection.
- Browser sizing verified at 1280px, 390px, and 320px across selection, sanctuary,
  character, and battle: equal battle slots, square images, contain fit, correct
  natural sizes, and no horizontal overflow.
